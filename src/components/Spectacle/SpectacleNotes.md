npm install â€”save spectacle

First impressions:
* Super easy to install and use
* I understand the code and it seems easy to manipulate for our needs
* It has an export to pdf, print and presenter mode built in
* Personalized theme options seem pretty good, so we can make it our own: https://formidable.com/open-source/spectacle/docs/themes 

I just copied https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/main/examples/js/index.js and pasted it into a scrap project file I made. I had to change the last two lines to just export default the presentation. Then I added it to the nav and the app.js files.
